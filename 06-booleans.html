      console.log(5 ==='5.00'); // returns false becuase === operator checks if the 2 values are equal (same for !==)

     // short cut for a if else statement saving a value to a variable based on a true or false condition. 

     // gaurd operator && is similar to the AND operator but is used outside an if statement. If one part of the line is false, exits that line of code immediately. 
     const message = false && console.log('message');// wont run because of false and guard operator. Short cut for if statement setting a variable to a certain value. 

     // default operator sets the value of a variable to whichever value is true. If both are true the first value is saved
     const currency = 'EUR' || 'USD';
     console.log(currency) // will out put EUR but if EUR was replaced by undefinded, it would output USD. Sets a default statement.
